**Mencari Makna Lewat Rasa Ingin Tahu**
Halo! Perkenalkan, saya **Della Novita** — tapi kamu bisa panggil saya **Della**. Saya adalah seorang perempuan, anak pertama dalam keluarga, dan seseorang yang sejak kecil memiliki rasa penasaran yang besar terhadap banyak hal.

Perjalanan saya dimulai sejak menginjak bangku SMK. Saat itu, saya diarahkan untuk mengambil jurusan Elektronika — sebuah pilihan yang awalnya tidak begitu saya minati. Namun justru dari situlah saya mulai mengenal dunia teknik. Saya belajar tentang bagaimana komponen kecil bisa membentuk sebuah televisi, bagaimana listrik mengalir dan diciptakan, hingga bagaimana teknologi menyatu dalam kehidupan kita sehari-hari. Semakin saya pelajari, semakin besar pula rasa ingin tahu saya. Dan rasa ingin tahu itulah yang menjadi bahan bakar utama saya hingga hari ini.

Have you ever wondered what you truly want as you grow older? Have you pondered on the aspirations you hold for yourself at the age of 30, or even 40? These are the questions that have lingered in my mind for a considerable stretch of time. They plagued me during high school and continued to persist throughout my undergraduate years. I embarked on a journey to decipher the essence of life and the significance of work. Was money the sole driving force that would propel me forward? Deep down, I knew that couldn't be the sole answer.

I encountered a crossroads during my second internship – an experience that I found myself disliking immensely. It led me to question the true purpose of my efforts. The persistent discomfort I felt during that period began to cast doubts over my path, making me contemplate quitting, regardless of the offered salary. However, something shifted, something clicked, which reignited the spark of passion within me for my future endeavors. This transformation was not fleeting; its impact has endured and continues to resonate with me to this day.

I've come to realize that creative fulfillment is an indispensable part of my life. As I delved into the world of the financial industry, a stark truth became evident: my role, despite being labeled as a financial analyst, was primarily centered around product promotion. This realization was a source of immense frustration for me. It dawned on me that I couldn't channel my passion effectively into a job that revolved solely around product promotion. I couldn't summon the enthusiasm to excel in a role that lacked a genuine sense of purpose.

During this moments, I'd find myself gazing enviously at the construction workers working diligently outside my office windows. It was in those instances that I unearthed the key to igniting my passion. I recognized that my true calling was deeply intertwined with creation – the act of building something from scratch, regardless of the sacrifices that might be required.
